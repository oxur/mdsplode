*A CLI tool for exploding and serialising Markdown files (metadata, AST, rendered parts, and rendered whole)*

## About

This tool came about as a result of a pressing need in some LFE projects that needed finer-grained processing of Markdown files for publishing projects.

## Dependencies

This tool filters using `jq` query strings and this requires that you let `mdsplode` know where your `jq` and other dependent libs are installed. If you're on a mac and `jq` was installed with homebrew, you can get the lib directories with the following:

```shell
brew list jq
```

```shell
/opt/homebrew/Cellar/jq/1.6/bin/jq
/opt/homebrew/Cellar/jq/1.6/include/ (2 files)
/opt/homebrew/Cellar/jq/1.6/lib/libjq.1.dylib
/opt/homebrew/Cellar/jq/1.6/lib/ (2 other files)
/opt/homebrew/Cellar/jq/1.6/share/doc/ (4 files)
/opt/homebrew/Cellar/jq/1.6/share/man/man1/jq.1
```

```shell
brew list oniguruma
```

```shell
/opt/homebrew/Cellar/oniguruma/6.9.7.1/bin/onig-config
/opt/homebrew/Cellar/oniguruma/6.9.7.1/include/ (2 files)
/opt/homebrew/Cellar/oniguruma/6.9.7.1/lib/libonig.5.dylib
/opt/homebrew/Cellar/oniguruma/6.9.7.1/lib/pkgconfig/oniguruma.pc
/opt/homebrew/Cellar/oniguruma/6.9.7.1/lib/ (2 other files)
```

Use these to set the `JQ_LIB_DIR` environment variable; in this case:

```shell
export JQ_LIB_DIR=/opt/homebrew/Cellar/jq/1.6/lib
export ONIG_LIB_DIR=/opt/homebrew/Cellar/oniguruma/6.9.7.1/lib
```

With these set to the appropriate values for your system, running `make build` should result in a usable `./bin/mdplode`.

## Usage

```shell
./bin/mdsplode \
    --input ./tests/data/learn.md \
    --query '.children.nodes'
```
