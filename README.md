*A CLI tool for exploding and serialising Markdown files (metadata, AST, rendered parts, and rendered whole)*

## About

This tool came about as a result of a pressing need in some LFE projects that needed finer-grained processing of Markdown files for publishing projects.

## Dependencies

The project is written in Rust and depends upon that toolchain as well as the usual gcc toolchain. In addition, the library files for `jq` and `oniguruma` are needed. For instructions on how to install these, see [Supporting jq Queries](./docs/jq-support.md).

## Usage

```shell
./bin/mdsplode \
    --input ./tests/data/learn.md \
    --query '.children.nodes' \
    --pretty
```
